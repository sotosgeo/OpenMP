    Decided its going to be the Monte Carlo approach to calculating the value of pi.
    Suppose that we throw darts at a square target, with 2 m wide sides, and its inscribed circle.
    The circle's radius is 1 m and its area is pi m^2.
    If the points on which the darts land, are uniformely distributed (and the arrows all hit their mark),
    then
