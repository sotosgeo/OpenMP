This program estimates the value of π, by using a Monte Carlo area simulation.

Suppose that we throw darts at a square target, with 2 m wide sides, and its inscribed circle.
The circle's radius is 1 m and its area is π m^2.
If the points on which the darts land, are uniformely distributed (and the arrows all hit their mark),
then the number of arrows which hit the inside of the circle should, approximately, satisfy the equation:

(number of arrows inside circle) / (total throws) = π / 4.

We use this equation to approximate π, with a random number generator.
